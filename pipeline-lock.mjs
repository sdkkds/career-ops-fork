// pipeline-lock.mjs — a cross-process advisory lock for data/pipeline.md.
//
// appendToPipeline() (scan.mjs) is a plain read-modify-write: readFileSync,
// mutate the string, writeFileSync. It's exported and called from three
// places — scan.mjs itself, scan-ats-full.mjs, and plugins.mjs (pipeline
// mode) — so any two of them running concurrently (a scheduled scan
// overlapping a manual `/career-ops pipeline` run, or two plugin jobs) can
// silently drop one side's offers: whichever write lands second overwrites
// the first's in-memory read, with no error and no trace anything was lost.
//
// Protocol — deliberately the same shape as the tracker lock in
// tracker-utils.mjs, so there is one lock idiom in the codebase:
//   - the lock is a directory ("<path>.lock"); a mkdir is atomic.
//   - the holder records owner.json — pid, a unique token, started_at — so
//     both stale-reclaim and release can verify who actually owns the lock
//     before deleting anything.
//   - staleness is judged by owner-PID liveness first, falling back to
//     directory age only when the metadata is missing or unreadable. An old
//     lock whose owner is still running is NOT stale, and an ownerless
//     directory gets a fixed grace period (OWNERLESS_GRACE_MS) before age
//     alone can condemn it, so a directory created microseconds ago is never
//     reclaimable no matter how aggressive the caller's staleMs.
//   - stale reclamation is serialized behind a second atomic guard directory
//     ("<path>.lock.recover"). Without it, reclamation is itself a TOCTOU
//     race: two callers that both judge the same lock stale can have the
//     second one's rmSync delete the first one's freshly created lock, after
//     which both believe they hold it — reintroducing the very race this
//     module exists to close, just gated behind a crash + contention window.
//
// Timing is caller-configurable (with these defaults) so tests can exercise
// contention in milliseconds instead of waiting out a multi-second constant.
